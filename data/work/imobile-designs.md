# Client Projects at Imobile Designs

Delivered full-stack solutions for three major clients, building secure backend systems, responsive UIs, and mobile app integrations that streamlined business operations and enhanced user experiences.

<div id="overview">

## Overview

As a Full-Stack Developer Intern at Imobile Designs, I contributed to three key client projects spanning Android development, frontend implementation, and backend system architecture. Each project presented unique technical challenges that required adapting to different technology stacks and client requirements.

### The Company

Imobile Designs is a tech consultancy specializing in digital solutions for businesses across the United States and India. The company focuses on delivering custom software development ranging from Android applications to full-stack web systems, with an emphasis on quality delivery for startups and established businesses.

### My Role

- **Position:** Full-Stack Developer Intern
- **Responsibilities:** Delivered complete modules independently across mobile, backend, and frontend platforms
- **Collaboration:** Worked directly with senior developers and clients for project handoffs, revisions, and technical discussions
- **Impact:** Contributed to three major client deliverables with measurable business outcomes

### Key Client Projects

- **Bricks R US** – Android App Integration with PHP backend system
- **Velriders** – Complete UI Implementation from Figma designs
- **Unnamed Marketplace** – Secure backend system using Node.js and PostgreSQL

## The Challenge

### Business Problem

Each client faced critical gaps in their digital infrastructure that were limiting their business growth and user engagement. The projects required rapid development cycles while maintaining high quality standards and seamless integration with existing systems.

### User Pain Points

- **Limited Mobile Access** - Bricks R US customers couldn't access services through mobile devices, reducing engagement and limiting market reach
- **Design-to-Code Gap** - Velriders experienced significant delays in product releases due to inconsistent frontend implementation from design mockups
- **Vendor Registration Bottleneck** - The marketplace project had no secure system for vendors to register and list products, creating manual overhead and security concerns

### Technical Constraints

- **Legacy System Integration** - Had to work with existing PHP APIs for Bricks R US without breaking current functionality
- **Pixel-Perfect Design Requirements** - Tight UI match requirements with Figma designs for Velriders across all breakpoints
- **Infrastructure Limitations** - No cloud infrastructure available for marketplace project, requiring self-managed server deployment and optimization

### Success Metrics

- **Bricks R US:** Functional mobile app with seamless backend integration
- **Velriders:** 100% design fidelity with responsive support across devices
- **Marketplace:** Secure vendor onboarding system with sub-200ms API response times

## Our Solution

### Development Process

Adopted an agile approach with weekly client check-ins, rapid prototyping, and iterative development cycles. Each project required different technology stacks and methodologies based on client needs and existing infrastructure.

### Key Features

#### Feature 1: Android App Integration (Bricks R US)

**Problem it solves:** Enabled mobile access to existing PHP backend services

**How it works:** Built native Android application using Java and XML layouts, integrated with legacy PHP APIs through Retrofit networking library

**Design decisions:** Maintained consistency with existing web interface while optimizing for mobile user experience, implemented robust error handling and validation

#### Feature 2: Responsive Frontend Implementation (Velriders)

**Problem it solves:** Bridged the design-to-code gap for faster product delivery

**How it works:** Converted complete Figma designs into responsive UI using Laravel Blade templating and Bootstrap framework

**Design decisions:** Prioritized pixel-perfect design fidelity while ensuring cross-browser compatibility and optimal performance across all device sizes

#### Feature 3: Secure Backend System (Marketplace)

**Problem it solves:** Created secure vendor registration and product listing infrastructure

**How it works:** Developed RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL with JWT authentication and role-based access control

**Design decisions:** Implemented scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns, optimized database queries, and established comprehensive API documentation

### Technical Implementation

- **Android Development:** Java + XML with Retrofit for API consumption
- **Frontend Development:** Laravel Blade + Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Backend Development:** Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL with PM2 + Nginx deployment
- **Security:** JWT authentication, input validation, and secure data transmission protocols
